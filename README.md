# youtube_api
Nothing fancy just a simple video search based on a YouTube API.  
Layout: A textbox to type and search a video. Added a button to submit the request.  
Logic: Used JavaScript to hold API Key. Also, used jQuery/Ajax to make asynchronous calls to back-end.  
Back-end: Used PHP and MySQL.  
Style: Used Bootstrap
